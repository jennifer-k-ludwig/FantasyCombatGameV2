# Fantasy Combat Tournament
The fantasy combat tournament is an extension of the [fantasy combat game](https://github.com/jennifer-k-ludwig/FantasyCombatGame). Each player is allowed to select 1-20 characters for their team, and give a name to each. Characters are placed in a queue. If a character wins a round, they are sent to the back of the queue, otherwise, they are placed in the loser stack. The winner of each round is based on the rules of the fantasy combat game.

## Usage
Each player chooses the number of characters, and a type and name for each.

During each round, two characters battle. The winner of each round is displayed and recovers a random percentage. At the end, the results are shown and there is the option to view the losers pile.
